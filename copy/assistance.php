<p>The IndieWeb community is building the foundation of a web controlled by individuals for themselves. It's crucial to have independent web creators from all backgrounds at IndieWeb Summit to have a rich discussion and build cool things.</p>

<p>For those who identify as female, queer, disabled, trans*, gender-nonconforming, or as a person of color, and otherwise could not afford to travel to IndieWeb Summit on your own, an anonymous donor has established a $1000 fund to assist individuals from underrepresented backgrounds with travel and/or lodging costs for the Indieweb Summit in Portland.</p>

<p>If you think that you could benefit from this fund, please <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/ME7ss6idRB">apply here</a>. You needn't be an IndieWeb expert or master hacker, just an excited participant willing to share and learn.</p>

<p class="smaller">If you would like to contribute to this fund so that we can provide assistance to more individuals from a diverse background, please contact <a href="mailto:aaron@parecki.com">Aaron Parecki</a>.</p>
